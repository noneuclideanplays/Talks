 @article{Chan_Kirkman_Walton_Zhang_2014, title={Quantum binary polyhedral groups and their actions on quantum planes}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.7203}, abstractNote={We classify quantum analogues of actions of ﬁnite subgroups G of SL2(k) on commutative polynomial rings k[u, v]. More precisely, we produce a classiﬁcation of pairs (H, R), where H is a ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra that acts inner faithfully and preserves the grading of an Artin-Schelter regular algebra R of global dimension two. Remarkably, the corresponding invariant rings RH share similar regularity and Gorenstein properties as the invariant rings k[u, v]G in the classical setting. We also present several questions and directions for expanding this work in noncommutative invariant theory.}, note={arXiv:1303.7203 [math]}, number={arXiv:1303.7203}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Chan, Kenneth and Kirkman, Ellen and Walton, Chelsea and Zhang, James}, year={2014}, month=jul, language={en} }

 @article{Cuadra_Etingof_Walton_2016, title={Finite dimensional Hopf actions on Weyl algebras}, url={http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.01165}, abstractNote={We prove that any action of a ﬁnite dimensional Hopf algebra H on a Weyl algebra A over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic zero factors through a group action. In other words, Weyl algebras do not admit genuine ﬁnite quantum symmetries. This improves a previous result by the authors, where the statement was established for semisimple H. The proof relies on a reﬁnement of the method previously used: namely, considering reductions of the action of H on A modulo prime powers rather than primes. We also show that the result holds, more generally, for algebras of diﬀerential operators. This gives an aﬃrmative answer to a question posed by the last two authors.}, note={arXiv:1509.01165 [math]}, number={arXiv:1509.01165}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Cuadra, Juan and Etingof, Pavel and Walton, Chelsea}, year={2016}, month=jul, language={en} }

Classical results such as Watanabe’s Theorem and Stanley’s Theorem are extended from the case of a group action to the context of a Hopf algebra action. A Hopf algebra version of the homological determinant is introduced, and it becomes an important tool in the generalization from group actions to Hopf algebra actions.}, number={10}, journal={Journal of Algebra}, author={Kirkman, E. and Kuzmanovich, J. and Zhang, J.J.}, year={2009}, month=nov, pages={3640–3669}, language={en} }
